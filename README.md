## Lazy loading

The lazy loading theme feature modifies default WordPress image and embed markup to faciliate lazy loading via the the modern transparent srcset pattern. The Lazysizes JavaScript library is enqueued automatically when using this feature.

### Usage

Enable lazy loading within your theme by using `add_theme_support` in your theme's `after_setup_theme` function.

```php
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'theme_setup' );

function theme_setup() {
	add_theme_support( 'speedrunner-enable-lazy-loading' );
}
```

### Styles

Lazysizes adds the class lazyloading while the images are loading and the class lazyloaded as soon as the image is loaded. The following styles should be added to your theme as a minimum starting point:

```css
/* fade image in after load */
.lazyload,
.lazyloading {
	opacity: 0;
}
.lazyloaded {
	opacity: 1;
	transition: opacity 300ms;
}
```

### Template functions

Lazy loading can be enabled on a per image basis by adding the `lazyload` class. Images can also be wrapped in a container with an optional intrinsic ratio. Containers can currently only be applied to post thumbnails when using the standard WordPress template functions. A custom `get_wrapped_attachment_image` function can be used to wrap other attachment images.

Lazy load the post thumbnail and wrap it in a container with an intrinsic ratio:
```php
the_post_thumbnail(
	'medium',
	[
		'class'   => 'lazyload',
		'wrapper' => 'u-ratio customClass',
		'ratio'   => true,
	]
);
```
The ratio is applied via an inline style with padding-bottom. The default ratio container class is `u-ratio`. The class can be customised by setting `wrapper` to a string.

Lazy load a WordPress image attachment:
```php
echo wp_get_attachment_image(
	get_post_thumbnail_id(),
	'medium',
	false,
	[
		'class' => 'lazyload',
	]
);
```

Lazy load a WordPress image attachment but wrapped in a container with an intrinsic ratio:
```php
use function Sup\SpeedRunner\Template\get_wrapped_attachment_image;

echo get_wrapped_attachment_image(
	get_post_thumbnail_id(),
	'medium',
	[
		'class'   => 'lazyload',
		'wrapper' => 'u-ratio customClass',
		'ratio'   => true,
	]
);
```

### Disable JavaScript
The Lazysizes JavaScript enqueued by SpeedRunner can be removed by passing the `'enqueue' => false` option when adding lazy loading theme support.

```php
add_theme_support(
	'speedrunner-enable-lazy-loading',
	[
		'enqueue' => false,
	]
);
```

## CDN version of jQuery

This SpeedRunner theme feature loads jQuery from the google CDN and fallsback to the local WordPress version when the CDN version is not available. The CDN version number is matched to the local WordPress version and resource hints are added for dns prefetching.

### Usage

Enable the CDN version of jQuery within your theme by using `add_theme_support` in your theme's `after_setup_theme` function.

```php
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'theme_setup' );

function theme_setup() {
	add_theme_support( 'speedrunner-enable-cdn-jquery' );
}
```

## Asset revisioning

Static asset revisioning by appending a content hash to filenames: unicorn.css â†’ unicorn-d41d8cd98f.css.

### Usage

Use [gulp-rev](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-rev) to automatically generate hashed file names and an asset manifest.

Enable asset revisioning within your theme by using `add_theme_support` in your theme's `after_setup_theme` function.

```php
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'theme_setup' );

function theme_setup() {
	add_theme_support( 'speedrunner-enable-asset-revisioning' );
}
```

Then get asset urls within your theme using the `get_theme_file_uri` function.

Getting an image url:
```php
<img src="<?php echo get_theme_file_uri( 'assets/dist/images/logo.png' ) ?>" alt="" />;
```

Enqueuing scripts or styles:
```php
wp_enqueue_style( '_s-styles', get_theme_file_uri( 'assets/dist/styles/theme.css' ), [], '0.1.0' );
wp_enqueue_script( '_s-script', get_theme_file_uri( 'assets/dist/scripts/theme.bundle.js' ), [ 'jquery' ], '0.1.0', true );
```

By default the dist directory is set to `assets/dist/`. This can be customised when enabling theme support:
```php
add_theme_support(
	'speedrunner-enable-asset-revisioning',
	[
		'dist_path' => 'assets/dist/',
	]
);
```
